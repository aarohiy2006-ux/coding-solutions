# Stone Removal Game

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing stones from a pile, with  *Alice going first*.

- Alice starts by removing exactly 10 stones on her first turn.
- For each subsequent turn, each player removes exactly 1 fewer stone than the previous opponent.

The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if Alice wins the game and `false` otherwise.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  n = 12

 **Output:**  true

 **Explanation:** 

- Alice removes 10 stones on her first turn, leaving 2 stones for Bob.
- Bob cannot remove 9 stones, so Alice wins.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  n = 1

 **Output:**  false

 **Explanation:** 

- Alice cannot remove 10 stones, so Alice loses.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 50

        int x = 10;
        boolean aliceTurn = true;

        while (n >= x) {
            n = n - x;
            x--;

            aliceTurn = !aliceTurn;
        }

        return !aliceTurn;
    }
}
```
